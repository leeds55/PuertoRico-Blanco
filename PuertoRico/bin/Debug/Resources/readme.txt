Use this program at your own risk! I assume no responsibility for any adverse effects the game has on your PC.

Requirements - Microsoft Windows with .NET extensions installed

Notes: 
- If you just do a "new" game, it will start by default a 3 player game with you in seat 1, and default names. To 	change player names, and number of players, choose "Setup" in the "Game" menu.

- The "pic" directory needs to be there for the game to have graphics. 

- This game is for ONE PLAYER ONLY. There is no network or hot-seat play.

- if it seems like you cant get the game to progress, look on the main player mat (yours), there is probably a button in the center waiting to be pressed.

- If I remember correctly, the rules I programmed for the Wharf may be incorrect

- To distribute colonists...click an empty space to add a colonist IF there are available ones in San Juan - click a colonist to send him to San Juan - click "done" in the center of the map when you are done distributing.

- The AI is almost bearable, to say the least. It's like playing with uber-newbies. It's fairly random. It may even 	annoy some people. It is what it is


History:
	I orignally wanted to create a quick application to allow me to practice opening game moves. I wanted the computer to randomly choose some roles so I could react approriately to them. That's all I was originally shooting for. 3 months later, I get the program to a point where you can play a complete game. The AI (I hesitate to even call it 'AI') will do certan things, mostly based on some preset percentages. For example, most of the time the start player, if AI, will choose settler/quarry...but not always. The AI will also usually attempt to save up money to buy larger buildings...but again, not always. I finished coding this over a year and a half ago, so I don't remember alot of the inner-workings of why the AI does what it does. I have no plans to continue development, I just wanted to make it available so it didn't go away without at least a handful of people messing around with it. 

If you are a serious PR player, then this will seem like a huge pile of steaming &^&^($ and I don't blame you for thinking that. However, if you are a very causal player, then this might be just the thing you need to play a quick game or two at your desk during lunch. Don't worry about being able to beat the AI...just try to see how bad you can trounce it. If nothing else, it *looks* like a real game of PR.
